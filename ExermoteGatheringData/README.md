# Exermote Gathering Data

Since the later learning procedure is supervised, labeled data is needed.

**Setting**

To record training data of different individuals I used 2 different types of devices:

- Iphone on right upper arm: 12 data features (3x gravity, 3x acceleration, 3x euler angle, 3x rotation rate)
- 6x <a href="https://estimote.com">Estimote Nearables</a> on chest, belly, hands and feet: each 3 data features (3x acceleration)

So there are 30 data features in total. The Nearables were reshaped by using Stewalin, a muffin form and some Velcro cable ties :)
